                        Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, 
                        yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce <b>StarDojo</b>, 
                        a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production–living simulations. 
                        In <b>StarDojo</b>, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, 
                        while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. 
                        <b>StarDojo</b> features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, 
                        and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. 
                        The benchmark is designed with a unified, user-friendly interface without the need for keyboard and mouse control, 
                        supports all mainstream operating systems, and enables parallelized execution of multiple environment instances, 
                        making it particularly suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). 
                        Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, 
                        GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, 
                        multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, 
                        <b>StarDojo</b> aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

                    <!-- <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Realistic Dynamics</span>. Each in-game day in Stardew Valley lasts from 6 AM to 2 AM. 
                        When nightfall occurs, outdoor activities will be affected due to the darkness. 
                        Staying awake past midnight will result in penalties. Players start each day with 270 energy points, 
                        spent through activities like farming and mining, and restored by sleeping or eating. 
                        The game features four 28-day seasons and different daily weather conditions, each affecting farming, forage and other events. 
                        Effective management of time and energy is crucial to maximizing productivity and overcoming the game's primary challenges.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Diverse Social Interaction</span>. 
                        Beyond farm production, Stardew Valley features 45 unique NPCs, each with distinct personalities, 
                        daily routines, and special heart events. Players can build friendships by offering gifts, 
                        and may even date, marry, and raise children with villagers. Periodically, the town hosts festivals and special events,

                    <p>
                        As a classical video game, Stardew Valley only supports human-like interaction, e.g., 
                        observing gameplay through screenshots and using keyboard and mouse to control. The game must remain active and focused in the foreground, 
                        which severely limits the ability to automate gameplay or run multiple instances simultaneously. 
                        We introduce our carefully designed <b>StarDojo</b> environment to facilitate agents' interaction and assessment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Unified User-friendly Interface</span>. 
                        We present StarDojoMod, a novel extension built upon the Stardew Modding API (SMAPI), 
                        which is a widely adopted, open-source modding framework designed specifically for Stardew Valley. 
                        SMAPI offers developers extensive APIs that expose key game events and internal states, 
                        facilitating the creation of interactive and sophisticated mods. Based on SMAPI, 
                        StarDojoMod provides structured and efficient interactions between agents and the game environment. 
                        It communicates in real-time with the Stardew Valley game engine through a socket server, 
                        granting agents direct access to rendered gameplay images, saving the time-consuming screen captures, 
                        internal game states (such as character positions, statuses, and environmental details), 
                        and enabling diverse callable functions as action skills beyond traditional keyboard and mouse inputs. 
                        Moreover, we implemented a configurable pause-and-resume mechanism by directly modifying the inner states of the game, 
                        allowing the game to pause during agent planning and resume before action execution. 
                        Inherited from SMAPI, StarDojoMod is implemented in C\# to be consistent with the game engine. 
                        To enhance ease-of-use and accessibility of the environment, 
                        we provide a user-friendly Python Wrapper based on the StarDojoMod for observation retrieval, action execution, 
                        and task customization, empowering users to engage with the StarDojo environment effortlessly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">System Compatibility</span>. 
                        Stardew Valley is one of the few games that can be played on all mainstream operating systems (Linux, macOS and Windows). 
                        We also ensured the compatibility of StarDojoMod and the Python Wrapper, 
                        enabling the entire environment to run seamlessly across different systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Parallel Execution</span>. 
                        Our architecture is designed for scalability and parallel execution. 
                        Each instance of Stardew Valley is independently managed through unique ports, 
                        enabling simultaneous control of multiple game instances without interference. 
                        Communication efficiency is further enhanced through the use of shared memory, 
                        reducing observation retrieval time to as little as 30 milliseconds. Furthermore, 
                        StarDojoMod supports headless operation through the X Virtual Framebuffer (Xvfb), 
                        enabling compatibility with Linux systems without graphical interfaces, 
                        thus broadening accessibility across diverse hardware and system configurations.

                        Each task is classified into three difficulties, easy, medium, and hard, 
                        with a heuristic maximum steps of 30, 50 and 150, based on their complexity and the time consuming. 
                        To facilitate efficient agent evaluation, we curate a representative smaller task suite, called <b>StarDojo-Lite</b>, 
                        comprising 100 core tasks from the full task collection, balancing coverage and practicality. 
                        This lite task set covers most of the representative activities in the early stage of the game.

                        Across all evaluated models, <strong>GPT-4.1</strong> achieves the highest overall success rate of <strong>12.7%</strong> across all tasks, 
                        while other models perform below <strong>11%</strong>. Among open-source models, <strong>Llama 4 Maverick</strong> demonstrates the strongest performance, 
                        benefiting from its larger model size. Most successful completions are limited to easy tasks, 
                        whereas all models struggle significantly with medium and hard tasks, 
                        achieving near-zero success rates due to increased task complexity and longer sequences of required actions. 
                        Models show some proficiency in farming and crafting tasks but exhibit considerable difficulty in exploration, 
                        combat, and social interactions. These results highlight the significant remaining space for improvement of MLLMs, 
                        particularly in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning, low-level manipulation, and long-term planning.

                        Removing textual input (<span style="font-weight: bold">Image Only</span>) significantly affects agents' performance across all tasks, 
                        reflecting the defect of base models' poor visual-based control, 
                        emphasizing textual information's importance in grounding detailed action decisions for the current stage of agents. 
                        On the other side, eliminating visual input (<span style="font-weight: bold">Text Only</span>) 
                        substantially reduces success in tasks that require navigation like <span style="font-weight: bold">Ship 1 Parsnip</span> 
                        and <span style="font-weight: bold">Go to Bus Stop</span>, 
                        demonstrating the essential contribution of visual cues to spatial reasoning and movement. 
                        Disabling the feature to pause the environment (<span style="font-weight: bold">Real-time</span>) 
                        remarkably affects performance across tasks demanding timely reactions or prolonged action sequences.
                        For example, in combat scenarios like <span style="font-weight: bold">Kill 1 Bug</span>, 
                        the target (bug) continues moving during model inference, which can take over 10 seconds per request for GPT-4.1 via API. 
                        By the time the action is executed, the bug has often moved far from its previous position, 
                        rendering the action ineffective. Similarly, in long-horizon tasks like <span style="font-weight: bold">Chop 20 Wood</span>, 
                        the in-game clock advances continuously during inference. With pausing enabled, the task may be completed in just 2 in-game hours; 
                        without pausing, it can take over 12 in-game hours, frequently pushing completion into the night or spanning multiple in-game days. 
                        These findings highlight the practical importance of real-time evaluation, an aspect often overlooked in prior benchmarks.

                        Overall, 
                        we introduce StarDojo, a novel environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the open-ended behaviors of MLLM agents in Stardew Valley. 
                        StarDojo bridges the gap in existing environments by enabling comprehensive assessment of agents 
                        across both production and daily living activities within a simulated nature and society. 
                        Featuring a set of diverse tasks, StarDojo exposes significant challenges in current agents' visual understanding, 
                        multimodal reasoning, long-term planning, and real-time inference, highlighting key areas for future research and development.
